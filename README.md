The most challenging part was Adobe premier as it was something completely new and I needed to research a bit about it. There were also some errors in stitching but I did my best to overcome them.
Another challenging thing is the "AVPro" package which I used and didn't know how to use it. So I edited one of the scripts in the "Demo" folder and tried my best to make it look and sound good.

What I liked was the final output and how it worked.
